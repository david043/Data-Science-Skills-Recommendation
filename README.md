# Data-Science-Skills-Recommendation

The goal of the Data Science Skills Recommendation project is to parse all the top skills used in the Data Science world (and also Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Business Analysis,...). 
This way, a new comer to the field can input his resume and see live which skills are more relevant for the position he is targeting.

Further explanation will be provided along with the development of the project.
