We are data and application engineers, serving and empowering all Nordstrom teams and functions with high-quality data and data services and products.

We instrument Nordstrom sites and apps to measure customer experiences, ingest and process that data, and build amazing applications and real-time feeds on it. We are a small but highly agile and productive team of full-stack engineers. We value work/life balance but love what we do and there is no clock for us.

You are a data geek and puzzle solver, agile in node.js, Python, SQL, Docker, Kubernetes, APIs, AWS, Google Cloud, and more. You are left-brained, right-brained, or both. You are looking for a two-pizza team that has fun but is serious about building cool stuff, getting it done, and measuring data upon data to document its impact on the business.

IDMS Database Administrator (DBA) with 8-10+ years of experience working as an application DBA in a production support environment. Must possess good knowledge of industry standards.

Experience with IDMS version 18 or higher. Excellent performance and tuning skills required. Proactively prevent database issues by closely monitoring the databases on a regular basis and implementing the tools and procedures required to maintain a very stable environment. Excellent verbal and writing skills are critical.

Client facing role. Communicate and coordinate with other support groups. US Eastern/US Central Time zone work hours required. Manage database performance, capacity and availability.

DBMS software implementation, upgrade, patching. 24 x 7 on call support. Create and maintain application database disaster recovery plans. Attend regular meetings with the client and account team.

Experience using CA tools and utilities. Experience with IDD, ADS/O, OLQ, Culprit, SYSGEN. Experience with DML and DDL. Experienced with z/OS utilities, JCL, SDSF or IOF.

Experience with CM tools such as Librarian or Endevor. Experience with ticketing and notification systems such as eNOTE, Service Manager, ServiceNow. Experience with ITIL Processes for Incident/Change/Problem/Request management. Work on an application DBA team performing IDMS database capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, as well as backup and data recovery.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES Installation, configuration, upgrade, and migration. This job role requires knowledge of the hardware prerequisites for an efficient database environment, and communicating those requirements to the system administrator. The DBA installs the database software and selects from various options in the product to configure it for the purpose it is being deployed. As new releases and patches are developed, it's the DBA's job to decide which are appropriate and to install them.

Backup and recovery. Responsible for developing, implementing, and periodically testing a backup and recovery plan for the databases they manage. Final responsibility for making sure that the backups are being done as scheduled and that they include all the files needed to make database recovery possible after a failure. When failures do occur, the DBA needs to know how to use the backups to return the database to operational status as quickly as possible, without losing any transactions that were committed.

There are several ways the database can fail, and the DBA must have a strategy to recover from each. From a business standpoint, there is a cost to doing backups, and the DBA makes management aware of the cost/risk tradeoffs of various backup methods. Database security. Because databases centralize the storage of data, they are attractive targets for hackers and even curious employees.

The DBA must understand the particular security model that the database product uses and how to use it effectively to control access to the data. The three basic security tasks are authentication (setting up user accounts to control logins to the database), authorization (setting permissions on various parts of the database), and auditing (tracking who did what with the database). The auditing task is particularly important currently, as regulatory laws like Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA have reporting requirements that must be met. Storage and capacity planning.

The primary purpose of a database is to store and retrieve data, so planning how much disk storage will be required and monitoring available disk space are key DBA responsibilities. Watching growth trends are important so that the DBA can advise management on long-term capacity plans. Performance monitoring and tuning. The DBA is responsible for monitoring the database on a regular basis to identify any bottlenecks (parts of the system that are slowing down processing) and remedy them.

Tuning a database is done on multiple levels. The capacity of the hardware and the way the operating system is configured can become limiting factors, as can the database software configuration. The way the database is physically laid out on the disk drives and the types of indexing chosen also have an effect. The way calls against the database are coded can dramatically change how fast results are returned.

A DBA needs to understand which monitoring tools are available at each of these levels and how to use them to tune the system. Proactive tuning is an attitude of designing performance into an application from the start, rather than waiting for problems to occur and fixing them. It requires working closely with developers of applications that run against the database to make sure that best practices are followed so good performance will result. Troubleshooting.

When things do go wrong with the database, the DBA needs to know how to quickly ascertain the problem and to correct it without losing data or making the situation worse."

Blizzard Entertainment is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Global Insights team to partner with our respective analytics teams with technical leadership and vision, innovation and agility with big data at scale, and to develop a deep and rich subject matter expertise with the data most important to the franchise.
In this role, you will be responsible for providing accurate, timely, reliable, and ultimately useful data to the analytics group. This mandate involves everything from the discovery, access, and integration of source data into the ecosystem to guaranteeing its health and robustness within that ecosystem to modeling and presenting that data in a manner that allows stakeholders within the ecosystem to perform their duties effectively. You will have a delicate balance in this role: you work most closely with the other members of your group and translate their needs into agile, highly-customized implementations for franchise-specific data; at the same time, though, you work just as closely with the Core Data team both to ensure that your group does not introduce problematic deviations from core data and that the core data infrastructure itself is supporting your groups evolving needs; you are just as closely tied to the Tools and Technology team to ensure that your franchise-specific system usage is playing nice, playing fair within the greater analytical data ecosystem.

The ideal candidate uses the speed, agility, and targeted on-point damage of Cat form to meet the quick-shifting, high-impact immediate needs of his or her franchise group before morphing seamlessly into a Bear form, responsible for tanking the ongoing operational needs of the group as a whole. A shift to Moonkin allows for the push-and-pull flow of ideas between Blizzard Analytics and Core; and the final shift to Tree provides the stability and integration between the franchise group and the other users, approaches, policies, and procedures of the overall analytical data ecosystem.
Responsibilities
Design, develop, implement, and evolve franchise-specific data pipelines
Troubleshoot any performance, system or data related issues, and work to ensure data consistency and integrity
Work with the franchise team as technical lead and primary technical resource
Plan and coordinate franchise-specific technical projects

Our Core Values

1. We are one team - We are one team with a single goal - to build an amazing company. If the company wins, we all win. We build the team by looking for amazing teammates who will elevate the team over individual genius.

2. Always improving - We believe that best people never stop learning and growing and that the only way to do that is to be humble and eager to be better. We crave feedback, we aren't defensive, and we internalize it. We are also equally as comfortable giving constructive and helpful feedback.

3. We are all owners - We empower everyone at the company to own their work. Owners want lots of responsibility, have authority and freedom to make real decisions, surface bad news quickly, and ask for help when they need it. A company of owners also means that ideas come from everywhere, that we all learn from each other, and titles and seniority don't matter.

4. Scrappiness - We are trying to do something transformative while also taking on the biggest and most resourced companies in the world. The only way we can pull off the impossible is to simplify everything to its core, only spend time and money on what truly matters, and work very, very, very hard.

5. We have fun - Building a company is hard work, but is also needs to be incredibly fun and rewarding. We don't just work together; we also make the time to have fun. This includes team outings, dinners, ping pong, halo and clipper games.

Our challenges

We have been solving hard problems from the beginning and we have many more to go!

We have built cutting-edge Android and iOS data collection SDKs. We have licensed our technology to companies with much bigger teams, who failed to build the same SDKs. Our data processing pipeline receives over 1.4 TB of sensor data/day. Cleaning, storing and processing that amount of data in a cost-efficient manner is a great challenge! We have built a complex data modeling pipeline, which evaluates the sensor data through multiple models and then fuses the results to come to the final conclusion. We also need to match our sensor data to a real world place (e.g. McDonalds, Nike store, laundromat). There are many datasets available but all have weaknesses. We are working to smartly fuse them.

If these types of problems excite you, you are the correct person for us!

Big Data Software Engineer - Data License,Bloomberg,"Job Requisition Number: 63622

We love data, do you?

Financial institutions thrive on data and the Bloomberg Enterprise Content business satisfies their needs. Enterprise Content is a fast growing business that provides clients with rich programmatic access to the best financial data and services in the industry such as Reference, Pricing, Corporate Actions and Regulatory content sets.

Our team is responsible for storing detailed usage metrics on every piece of data taken down by our clients. We just don't stop there - our team develops applications and services to analyze the data and apply various pricing models to be able to bill our clients. Our pricing models involve optimizing usage patterns across multiple access points that our clients use to access financial data and require us to churn through 2 years of data (trillions of data points) in 2 hours.

Let's talk technology. To build a scalable ingestion pipeline for our usage metric data, we have picked Apache Kafka, one of the fastest distributed streaming platforms. Now we need to store that data - we use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and, for some use cases, HBase/Apache Phoenix. The data isnt very useful unless we can analyze it - thats where Apache Spark & MapReduce come in. We use other tools in the Hortonworks Hadoop distribution like Oozie for scheduling our billing jobs, and are investing in Jupyter Notebooks to give tech-savvy users more flexible and sophisticated ways to analyze our data.

As a part of building new products, our business users have to design new pricing models to offer products to our clients. Time to market is absolutely one of our key metrics. Our goal is to empower users to be able to configure various attributes that make up the pricing models and reduce the time it takes on the engineering side to build them.

These are big goals and were just getting started. Were looking for bright, knowledgeable, driven people to help us make key technical decisions on the architecture, processes, best practices, and direction of this initiative. You will be responsible for the research, development, and stability of this critical platform and its impact on one of the highest revenue businesses within Bloomberg.

We are looking for an experienced Java developer with a strong understanding of big data ecosystem to help drive our challenging vision.

Well trust you to:
Design and develop highly scalable, fault tolerant solutions

Lead from the front in building a configurable, operational independent system while understanding the challenges surrounding the current implementations.

Work effectively in a small, adaptable, agile team focused on business value and operational independence

Incorporate and adapt multiple technologies to help reach our goals of enterprise-wide usage and support for data-in-motion

Understand and enforce the right balance between innovation, experimentation, and delivering completed features to production in a timely manner

Understand the core business and apply the technologies to other use cases that drive the client facing business

Youll need to have:
5+ years of experience programming enterprise solutions in Java/Scala

3+ years of experience in Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache HBase or any other big data technologies

Excellent understanding of algorithms, data structures, object-oriented design and multi-threading

Stellar problem solving & communication skills and the ability to thrive in a highly collaborative and dynamic work environment

Experience with low-latency, high-volume, and high-availability distributed systems to support real time use cases.

Our Core Values

1. We are one team - We are one team with a single goal - to build an amazing company. If the company wins, we all win. We build the team by looking for amazing teammates who will elevate the team over individual genius.

2. Always improving - We believe that best people never stop learning and growing and that the only way to do that is to be humble and eager to be better. We crave feedback, we aren't defensive, and we internalize it. We are also equally as comfortable giving constructive and helpful feedback.

3. We are all owners - We empower everyone at the company to own their work. Owners want lots of responsibility, have authority and freedom to make real decisions, surface bad news quickly, and ask for help when they need it. A company of owners also means that ideas come from everywhere, that we all learn from each other, and titles and seniority don't matter.

4. Scrappiness - We are trying to do something transformative while also taking on the biggest and most resourced companies in the world. The only way we can pull off the impossible is to simplify everything to its core, only spend time and money on what truly matters, and work very, very, very hard.

5. We have fun - Building a company is hard work, but is also needs to be incredibly fun and rewarding. We don't just work together; we also make the time to have fun. This includes team outings, dinners, ping pong, halo and clipper games.

Our challenges

We have been solving hard problems from the beginning and we have many more to go!

We have built cutting-edge Android and iOS data collection SDKs. We have licensed our technology to companies with much bigger teams, who failed to build the same SDKs. Our data processing pipeline receives over 1.4 TB of sensor data/day. Cleaning, storing and processing that amount of data in a cost-efficient manner is a great challenge! We have built a complex data modeling pipeline, which evaluates the sensor data through multiple models and then fuses the results to come to the final conclusion. We also need to match our sensor data to a real world place (e.g. McDonalds, Nike store, laundromat). There are many datasets available but all have weaknesses. We are working to smartly fuse them.

If these types of problems excite you, you are the correct person for us!

ASRC Federal - Vistronix is currently seeking an experienced Software Engineer for a role on one of our subcontracts. This full time position affords the successful candidate the opportunity to work in an engaging, high-tech development environment, working with an excellent team and customer base.

Responsibilities The Customer is looking for an energetic, creative resource with a proven track record of successful technical project implementation. The Candidate must excel working within a team, showing a willingness to learn new technologies and demonstrating initiative. High performing candidates will be positively challenged as they interact with highly talented technical peers and a forward leaning leadership team. The software engineer will work within an Agile/Scrum development team to design, develop, integrate, test, and deploy COTS and custom components for a new, enterprise, Externalized Authorization Management (EAM) system.

This is an exciting phase for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as the future of Externalized Authorization will lead to a new set of paradigms for access control. Recent investments in IAM now leverage state of the art solutions using real, industry standards. Digital policies will be authored in a distributed manner, allowing policy changes to be implemented in near real time instead of weeks or months. Since not all customers live and work on one network, there is a recognition that enterprise IAM solutions should be made available for use on other networks. Cloud hosting will allow IAM services to leverage the full capabilities that make availability demands and self-healing services a reality. The software engineer will be a part of turning this vision into reality and will have the opportunity to learn new skills along the way. The software engineer will assist in the installation, deployment, and maintenance of the COTS product, making configuration changes as needed. Responsibilities will include interfacing with the infrastructure teams during upgrades or troubleshooting. The software engineer may support the development of new customer digital policies and integrating them with the enterprise service. The software engineer may interface with customers during digital policy creation, policy ingestion, policy integration, and testing. The software engineer will support the implementation of an automated unit and integration testing capability for access control policies and other service components using JUnit. While the ideal candidate has strong experience deploying solutions in a cloud environment, candidates without this experience will learn this process with the rest of the team. The software engineer will also assist in the creation of technical documentation and other routine programmatic and security accreditation artifacts. This is full lifecycle software management. While deployment of a COTS tool is the tactical project objective, development of Java components which call the COTS software APIs will be critical to achieving strategic objectives like delivering a highly scalable service, meeting uptime requirements through automation, and automating the distributed policy authoring process. The successful candidate may support end user training on the creation and management of access control policies. Interested candidates must have more than intermittent exposure to mandatory skills. Strong candidates will have a commanding knowledge of mandatory skills and be able to articulate depth and breadth of each skill.

The work location is in Northern Virginia. Local travel in the DC Metro area, and pager duty is required.

Qualifications
Demonstrated experience writing code in an object oriented language.

Experience working on an agile development team, writing and working off user stories.
Experience developing applications in a cloud environment.
Demonstrated, professional experience with deployments in the Sponsors environment.
Experience developing JUnit test cases or other automated testing experience.
