Key skills required: work experience on various clinical applications and Identity Management and Entitlements. perform analysis on data and various hospital systems.

Interview: in person 3281 Ridgeway Dr. Coralville, IA 52241

Role:

The University of Iowa Hospitals is looking for an individual to perform analysis on data and various hospital systems.

The position has two dimensions, Identity Management and Entitlements.

Identity management involves singling out the unique properties of each individual at the hospital. Not only simply, name and address, but to identify the various roles that person will play with their job at the hospital.

Entitlements involve evaluating the role and unique properties of that person's job at the hospital, but then to identify what clinical applications that person will need access to. That also translates into what particular data or access that person might need within those clinical applications. A cardiac nurse has different system access needs than an x-ray technician.

The person will then need to recognize patterns within the roles and access for the various users and identify any change or issue that might present during that analysis. They will need to recognize what they can fix and what they need to escalate to others and then work the solution into their day to day analysis.

Any specific procedural duties required for the various clinical applications will be included in training once the individual starts this position and will be ongoing as needed.

IBM Data Scientist: Apprentice,IBM,"Job Description
Data Scientist: Apprentice

IBM's Tech Re-Entry program develops talented technical professionals who are looking to restart their careers after an absence from the workforce of two years or more. This paid 12 week internship enables participants to work on projects that match their expertise, interests, and abilities and could lead to full-time employment. In the same way an internship offers a guided period of exploration, the IBM Tech Re-entry internship program provides participants with an opportunity to update their skills in a work environment that may have significantly changed since their last experience. Interns will have access to the latest tools and technologies available and work alongside a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and business professionals to hone their expertise and focus on the next generation of software. The program will also provide the opportunity to experience the breadth of IBM resources while developing new relationships. Internship positions are currently available for Data Scientist located in RTP, North Carolina.

Data Scientist is responsible for converting business problems into an analytics solution using their consulting skills, business knowledge to analyze client business issues, formulate hypotheses and test conclusions to determine appropriate solutions methods.
A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math.
What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source  a CRM system, for example  a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure.

Required Technical and Professional Expertise

2 years or more out of the work force
At least 3 years of experience in a quantitative field with a science or engineering focus.
Strong programming skills in one of the following: R, SAS, Python, SQL

Summer Research Program Intern in Data Clustering,MIT Lincoln Laboratory,"About the Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group :

The Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group develops prototypes to demonstrate innovative command and control technology and open system architectures that measurably improve intelligence and military decision making. This work begins with an understanding of the workflows of intelligence analysts and military commanders, often through operations research. Operational data sets are amassed to support all types of algorithm development, such as multisensor fusion, big data mining, cloud technologies, graph-based network detection, and artificial intelligence, including deep learning. The group guides the nation in the adoption of open architecture standards in air, space, and cyber platforms. Prototype systems for data exploitation and knowledge management are delivered for evaluation in theater. Areas of technical staff expertise include systems analysis, modeling and simulation, feature extraction and pattern analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, software development, and field experimentation.

Job Title: Summer Research Intern in Clustering with Probabilistic Programming

Position Description: As more and more features are aggregated together to attempt to extract meaning from data, it will be nearly impossible to collect all features for all measurements. To address this problem, algorithms are needed that can naturally account for missing features in multivariate data sets. Previous research has led to algorithms that can cluster multivariate Gaussian data with missing features in measurements. The summer research project will be to develop more advanced algorithms that can handle missing data. The current interest is in algorithms that can model prior distributions on cluster means and covariance matrices with the normal-Wishart distribution while still accounting for missing data fields. At this time, an analytic solution to the derivation of the posterior probability distribution is unknown. An alternative approach is to use numerical integration.

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to cluster data with missing fields with a probabilistic programming language. The project will require the development of a few different approaches to clustering multivariate data with missing data. The distributions will be restricted to normal, Wishart and T distributions. A probabilistic programming language will be used to write a variety of programs that numerically solve the required integrals to produce posterior estimates and to estimate the optimal assignments of incomplete data to clusters.

Requirement: The candidate should be enrolled in a BS, MS or PhD degree program with a major in electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, or a related field.

Desired Skills: The ideal candidate should have a firm grasp of Bayesian probability theory, statistics, integral calculus, linear algebra and the ability to program effectively in a probabilistic programming language. Experience with fourth-generation languages (MATLAB, R, or equivalent), machine learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques are highly desirable.

Keywords: Probabilistic programming, machine learning, probability theory, statistics, mathematics, clustering, missing data
