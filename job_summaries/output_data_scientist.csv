Machine Learning Model for Cancer Vaccine Design,Oak Ridge Associated Universities,"Project Description : The aim of this project is to develop a model for peptide-MHC interactions by combining data science tools with biophysical principles. The purpose of the model is to identify high-affinity peptides from a sample of potential sequences, as this information has direct application to the design of personalized cancer vaccines. The peptide-MHC interaction will be simulated using molecular dynamics, or using sampling and optimization techniques. The resulting atomic-scale structures of peptide-MHC complexes will be scored in order to identify high-affinity binders. The criteria for selecting binders will be learned from a collection of peptide-MHC binding examples, using machine learning and a set of features/descriptors design to characterize both the physicochemical properties of the interface as well as the dynamics of the interaction.

IBM Data Scientist: Apprentice,IBM,"Job Description
Data Scientist: Apprentice

IBM's Tech Re-Entry program develops talented technical professionals who are looking to restart their careers after an absence from the workforce of two years or more. This paid 12 week internship enables participants to work on projects that match their expertise, interests, and abilities and could lead to full-time employment. In the same way an internship offers a guided period of exploration, the IBM Tech Re-entry internship program provides participants with an opportunity to update their skills in a work environment that may have significantly changed since their last experience. Interns will have access to the latest tools and technologies available and work alongside a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and business professionals to hone their expertise and focus on the next generation of software. The program will also provide the opportunity to experience the breadth of IBM resources while developing new relationships. Internship positions are currently available for Data Scientist located in RTP, North Carolina.

Data Scientist is responsible for converting business problems into an analytics solution using their consulting skills, business knowledge to analyze client business issues, formulate hypotheses and test conclusions to determine appropriate solutions methods.
A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math.
What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source  a CRM system, for example  a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure.

Required Technical and Professional Expertise

2 years or more out of the work force
At least 3 years of experience in a quantitative field with a science or engineering focus.
Strong programming skills in one of the following: R, SAS, Python, SQL

Data Scientist,Supercell,"Do you actively question the orthodoxy, convention, and dogma held by your peers and/or the broader gaming industry? Are you tired of making decisions purely based on data with no intuition? Do you enjoy the challenge of a highly dynamic ecosystem and an unpredictable industry? If so, this is the team for you!

Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.

If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you. If you enjoy flipping seamlessly between the strategic big picture and the nuts and bolts, then we want to hear from you. If you can solve a Rubiks cube with one hand while winning a Clash Royale match with the other, its not really relevant (but we still want to hear from you).

About the role

Food for thought: How might we measure the impact of placing a massive ""Hog Rider"" statue in Asia's largest underground mall? How would you decide whether we should show an ad in next year's Super Bowl? How should we think about the value of players who don't spend a cent, but contribute heavily to a game's community?

If tackling these kinds of questions gets you fired up, let's talk.

With over 100 million people playing our games every day, marketing at Supercell operates in uncharted territory, and analytics & data science are the compass. Always on the cutting edge of mobile advertising, marketers at Supercell experiment aggressively and adjust on the fly. We collect data and nurture intuition and constantly balance between the two while making strategic recommendations and tactical optimizations to guide everything from massive global multi-channel marketing campaigns to agile hyper-local experiments.

Above all, data scientists at Supercell enjoy partnering with colleagues to answer critical and difficult questions. They only care about getting to the best POV, regardless of whether that requires a rigorous statistical model, a simplistic ad hoc approach, or more likely some combination of multiple lenses. Our data scientists are not secluded Ivory Tower wizards, but collaborative problem-solvers. The qualities we look for:
Collaborative: you enjoy working hand-in-hand with colleagues more than not
Strategic: you always have the strategic question in sight, and never get lost in the details or enamored with an inferior but intellectually more interesting approach
Storytelling: You are adept at weaving compelling, thoughtful narratives from data
Skeptical: you relish playing devil's advocate and being a professional, constructive skeptic
Fearless: you are unafraid of uncertainty, and don't get paralyzed when grappling with tricky questions or lack of good data
Adaptable: you are fully comfortable working in a team and industry that are constantly shifting and evolving

Requirements
5+ years of experience translating data to insight to recommendations
BS (MS/PhD Preferred) in quant discipline (e.g. Math/Hard Science, Stats, CS, EE, Econ)
Strong skills in SQL, R, and Python
Experience in time series analytics and machine learning models is a plus

Experience
Develop and evolve statistical models to guide measurement and optimization
Pilot new methods to measure brand new types of marketing efforts
Design and own marketing experiments in partnership with our Media team
Bridge the gap from data and analysis to critical business decisions
Provide a data-driven POV to balance our team intuition

About Supercell

Supercell aims to create games that millions of people will pay for years or decades to come. We believe the best people make the best games and that is who we are looking for. If you love games and are passionate about playing and crafting them, and you are looking for a job that provides you ownership and independence, this is the right place.

Supercell isn't an entertainment company, it isn't a start-up, and it isn't just any game company. our focus sets us apart. Focus means saying to to a lot. To release four games we have killed fourteen. We've shut down marketing campaigns because they weren't perfect for our players, and we've scrapped a ton of game features that were simply too niche.

We also believe that focus means staying small. We hire only the most passionate doers and arm them with the trust and support to make the biggest impact possible. As part of a small, independent team at Supercell, you'll be free to dream and succeed (and sometimes fail) big!"
